# Puregres

Converts sql into purescript code. Similar to https://github.com/rightfold/sqltopurs or https://github.com/FrigoEU/sqltopurs but written in node. Create a .env file in the root and add you db username eg.
`DB_USER=my_user_name`

Run the tests and look in the test/Queries directory to see how it works:
`npm t`
